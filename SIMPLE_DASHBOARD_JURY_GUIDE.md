## üé® **User Interface Design Philosophy**

### **Design Principles:**
- ‚úÖ **No Technical Jargon** - Uses simple, clear language
- ‚úÖ **Visual First** - Color-coded system everyone understands
- ‚úÖ **Instant Understanding** - Information visible at a glance
- ‚úÖ **Professional Appearance** - Suitable for legal/official presentations

### **Color System (Universal Understanding):**
```
üü¢ GREEN = SAFE AREAS
   ‚Ü≥ Normal mining operations can continue
   ‚Ü≥ Workers are protected
   ‚Ü≥ No immediate action required

üü° YELLOW = CAUTION AREAS  
   ‚Ü≥ Extra monitoring required
   ‚Ü≥ Increased safety measures
   ‚Ü≥ Workers should be alert

üî¥ RED = DANGER ZONES
   ‚Ü≥ Immediate evacuation required
   ‚Ü≥ Area must be cleared of personnel
   ‚Ü≥ Emergency protocols activated
```
